              When you hear the term “self-compassion,” you might immediately think of the word “nice,” or think that it’s a feeling reserved for the saintly and tenderhearted… that the rest of us are simply too busy to bother showing others any sort of kindness, let alone showing it to ourselves. But what if you found that was a misconception, and that compassion — especially for oneself — isn’t “nice,” but tough and resilient and even badass? And what if cultivating that “tough” self-compassion isn’t a fruitless endeavor at all, and could actually provide you with proven, long-term emotional benefits?
